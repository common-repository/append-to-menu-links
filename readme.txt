## Description
Append a string such as a hash to the end of menu links. Useful for creating menus that link to a section of a page without having to create a custom link or to add parameters to a page's URL, this way if your page ever changes you don't need to update the link.

## Installation
- Download and activate the plugin.
- On the Appearance > Menus page, click the "Screen Options" check the "hash" checkbox to enable the field.
- Now when editing a menu item there should be a "hash" field which will append anything you enter to the end of the menu link.
